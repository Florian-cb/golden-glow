# golden glow
 
Landing page idea for made-up product "Golden Glow". Theme is spray tan and body products. Site is responsive and compatible with all screen sizes.

This project showcases my commitment to high professional standards in front-end web development, emphasizing both efficiency and compatibility. I believe that productivity and time efficiency are crucial in the technology field. By achieving the same high-quality results and aesthetic appeal with less code and reduced development time, I help drive productivity and deliver long-term cost savings for the company.
